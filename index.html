<h2>The Algorithm</h2>

I code the A* algorithm base on the following poster.

<a href="http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarTutorial.htm">A* Pathfinding for Beginners</a>

It is very helpfull to get started. That link is for the beginners like the title said.

The following link
<a href="http://upe.acm.jhu.edu/websites/Benny_Tsai/Introduction%20to%20AStar.htm">Introduction to the A-Star Algorithm</a>
This is page is so important that I copy this page into a seperate page

 is the psucode I code in C++ code, this code I first use the plainer C
use the global variables and some simple array to depict the rectangle map. Later I code
a C# version graphic to display the map. Then I use the CLI/C++ to bind those two together
I think that we can bind the second development as the C# language as soon as we provide a 
better API.
